This is a roblox item buyer, i made this code because i didnt find a nice template of buying something with parsed ID on GitHub.

## How to use:

1) Paste in "cookie.txt" your .ROBLOSECURITY value.
2) Paste in "id.txt" id of the item you want to buy.
3) Run "main.py" and Done!

## FAQ:

1) How to get value of .ROBLOSECURITY? Open [roblox](https://www.roblox.com/home) or sing in after press F12 and press "Application" after in storage find a "Cookies" object and press "https://www.roblox.com" and in there you can see a .ROBLOSECURITY with a value which you need to copy and paste into "cookie.txt"
2) How to get id of the item which you want? First open [roblox](https://www.roblox.com/home) and get to the link of the item that you want to get, after, on the link of this item you can see a digits, that is an id of the item.
